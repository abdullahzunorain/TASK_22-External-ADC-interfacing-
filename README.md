### Task 22: External ADC Interfacing with ET2046

#### Overview
The STC89C52 microcontroller does not have a built-in ADC. We will interface an external ADC (ET2046) to read analog voltages from multiple sources like potentiometers, thermistors, and LDRs (Light Dependent Resistors). This task covers various applications using ET2046.

#### Instructions

1. **External ADC Setup:**
   - Download the **ET2046 datasheet** (in Chinese) from [this link](http://www.ruikang.net/upload/datasheet/ET2046.pdf).
   - Translate the datasheet to English using [OnlineDocTranslator](https://www.onlinedoctranslator.com/en/).
   - **ET2046 Overview**:
     - The ET2046 is a SAR ADC, initially designed for mobile devices for touch control and battery voltage measurement.
   - Study the datasheet to understand the pinout and communication protocol of ET2046.

2. **Develop a Driver for ET2046:**
   - Write a C driver to interface with the **ET2046 ADC** and read data from the ADC channels.
   - Ensure communication between the STC89C52 microcontroller and ET2046 using the appropriate protocol.

3. **Digital Voltmeter Design:**
   - Use the potentiometer **AD1** to vary voltage from 0-5V.
   - Display the voltage on the **LCD** by reading from the **AIN0** pin of the ADC (middle pin of the potentiometer).
   - Compare the voltage displayed on the LCD with a Digital Multimeter (DMM). Ensure the readings are very close.

4. **Thermometer Design:**
   - Read the thermistor attached to the **AIN1** input of the ADC.
   - Convert the voltage from the thermistor to temperature in degrees Celsius.
   - Display the temperature next to the potentiometer voltage on the **LCD**.

5. **Light Meter Design:**
   - Use the LDR connected to the **AIN2** pin of the ADC to measure light intensity.
   - Display the relative light intensity on the second line of the **LCD**.
     - Scale the LDR reading to display **0** for complete darkness and **100** for maximum light intensity (use a flashlight for testing).
   - Ensure all three readings (potentiometer voltage, temperature, and light intensity) are displayed simultaneously on the **LCD**.

6. **Automatic Air Conditioning Controller:**
   - Implement an AC controller that turns on/off based on:
     - **Temperature**: Turn **off** the AC below 26°C and turn **on** the AC above 29°C.
     - **Day/Night Detection**: Use the LDR to detect if it’s daytime. The AC controller should only work during the day.
   - Display **AC ON** or **AC OFF** on the right side of the second line of the **LCD**.
   - Ensure the AC stays off during the night, regardless of temperature.

7. **High Temperature Alert System:**
   - Use the potentiometer **AD1** to set a temperature threshold.
   - Display both the **set temperature** and the **current temperature** on the **LCD**.
   - If the thermistor’s temperature exceeds the set point, the **buzzer** should beep with short beeps (300 ms).
   - Scale the potentiometer voltage (0-5V) to set the temperature between 20°C and 40°C.

8. **Solar Load Management System:**
   - Detect **mains electricity status** using the potentiometer **AD1**:
     - Voltage > 4V: Mains electricity is present.
     - Voltage < 4V: Mains electricity failure.
   - Use the LDR to detect if it’s nighttime.
   - If **mains electricity fails** and it is **nighttime**, open a contactor to disconnect heavy loads (AC, heaters, etc.) to conserve battery power.
   - Use an **LED** to indicate the state of the contactor:
     - **ON** if the contactor is closed (power to load).
     - **OFF** if the contactor is open (load disconnected).

#### Notes:
- **LDR Calibration**: Optionally, you can implement a lux meter based on the LDR for precise light measurement. For advanced learning, refer to [this lux meter project](https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/projects/design-a-luxmeter-using-a-light-dependent-resistor/).
- The **buzzer** and **LED** will provide audio and visual feedback based on system status (temperature alerts, load management, etc.).
